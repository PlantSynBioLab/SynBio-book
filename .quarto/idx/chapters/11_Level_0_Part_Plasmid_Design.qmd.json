{"title":"Level 0 Part Plasmid Design","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Level 0 Part Plasmid Design"},"headingText":"Overview","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\nThis chapter introduces students to experimental design in the context of synthetic biology and the practical construction of Level 0 part plasmids using Modular Cloning (MoClo) and the Yeast Toolkit (YTK).\n\nWe build on the previous lecture's discussion of MoClo principles and emphasize hands-on experience with designing and assembling modular DNA parts for use in downstream genetic circuits.\n\n## Review of Modular Cloning (MoClo)\n\nModular Cloning allows the assembly of genetic parts—promoters, coding sequences, terminators, and other regulatory elements—into standardized expression cassettes. Each part is cloned into a **Level 0 plasmid**, which can be stored, replicated, and reused.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n- Uses **Type IIS restriction enzymes** (e.g., BsaI and BsmBI) that cut outside their recognition sites, allowing for **scarless assembly**.\n- Each part is flanked by **standardized 4 bp overhangs**, which determine its position and compatibility within an expression cassette.\n- Level 0 parts can be assembled into **Level 1 cassettes** (single gene), and multiple Level 1 cassettes can be assembled into **Level 2 constructs** (multigene systems).\n\n> TODO: Insert diagram illustrating MoClo hierarchy (L0, L1, L2).\n\n## Software Tools for Primer and Part Design\n\n### Benchling\n\nBenchling is a browser-based molecular biology tool for sequence annotation, primer design, and cloning simulations.\n\n**To use Benchling:**\n\n1. Import or create your DNA sequence.\n2. Annotate regions (promoter, CDS, terminator).\n3. Use the *\"Primer\"* tool to design and label forward and reverse primers.\n4. For reverse primers, use the *\"Copy Special > Reverse Complement\"* option.\n5. Simulate Golden Gate assembly using *Assembly Wizards* or manual cloning.\n\n### Ape (A Plasmid Editor)\n\nApe is a downloadable tool that allows simple manipulation of DNA sequences.\n\n- Supports reverse complement operations and editing.\n- Useful for flipping 3′ to 5′ primers back into 5′ to 3′ notation.\n\n> TODO: Include screenshot of Benchling or Ape with primer annotations.\n\n## Activity Instructions\n\nStudents worked from:\n\n- **YTK Assembly Manual (pages 12–26)**: This guide details how to construct each part type using standardized overhangs and restriction sites.\n- **YTK Overhangs Primers Sheet (Google Sheets)**: Shared class document for assigning and recording primer sequences and overhangs.\n\n### Group Workflow\n\n1. Open the manual and locate your assigned part type (e.g., Type 1, 2, 3A, 3B...).\n2. Record the **part name**, **5′ overhang**, **3′ overhang**.\n3. Design forward and reverse primers:\n    - Forward primer = [GC clamp] + [BsaI site] + [part-specific overhang] + [homology to template]\n    - Reverse primer = Same logic, but **reverse complement** of the sequence\n\n> TODO: Add primer design template for students to follow.\n\n### Primer Design Guidelines\n\n- Primers should always be written 5′ → 3′.\n- Include at least 4 bp **GC clamp** before the restriction site.\n- Use **BsaI** recognition site (GGTCTC) for Level 0 assembly.\n- Add part-specific overhangs immediately downstream of the enzyme site.\n- Add **GG** for fusion proteins (e.g., Type 3B parts) to maintain codon frame.\n- Include a **stop codon** and/or **XhoI site** for terminator parts as needed.\n\n> TODO: Insert example primer sequence and breakdown of its components.\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n### In-Frame Assembly\n\n- Coding sequences often require special care to preserve the reading frame across part boundaries.\n- For example, combining Type 3A and 3B parts (both coding) needs a GG insertion to keep translation in-frame.\n\n### Negative Controls\n\n- Use mutant promoters (e.g., PIA19mut) that lack binding sites to demonstrate ARF-specific activation.\n- Design primers that omit ARFs or use constitutively inactive variants as negative controls.\n\n> TODO: Provide table of part types and expected features (start codon, stop codon, etc.).\n\n## Constructing Level 0 Parts\n\nTo make a new Level 0 part:\n\n1. Identify the **source sequence** (synthesized, genomic DNA, etc.).\n2. Design primers to amplify the sequence:\n   - Add **BsaI site**, overhangs, and homology arms.\n3. PCR amplify the part.\n4. Digest both the PCR product and **Level 0 entry vector** with BsaI.\n5. Ligate the digested insert and vector.\n6. Transform into competent **E. coli** and select colonies.\n7. Screen clones by colony PCR or sequencing.\n\n> TODO: Include diagram showing Level 0 assembly via Golden Gate.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n- Double-check primer orientation and melting temperatures (55–72°C).\n- Avoid internal BsaI or BsmBI sites within the part sequence.\n- Use Benchling to simulate and verify assembly.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis activity combined theoretical and practical training in modular cloning. Students learned to:\n\n- Navigate cloning toolkits and design compatible parts\n- Use software to annotate sequences and design primers\n- Understand the logic of MoClo part assembly\n\nThese skills will be applied to build expression cassettes and multigene constructs for synthetic biology experiments in upcoming weeks.\n\n> TODO: Link to shared Google Sheet with part assignments and example sequences.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Finalize primer designs for assigned part types.\n- Submit sequences for synthesis or begin PCR amplification.\n- Prepare for Level 0 part cloning and validation.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Overview\n\nThis chapter introduces students to experimental design in the context of synthetic biology and the practical construction of Level 0 part plasmids using Modular Cloning (MoClo) and the Yeast Toolkit (YTK).\n\nWe build on the previous lecture's discussion of MoClo principles and emphasize hands-on experience with designing and assembling modular DNA parts for use in downstream genetic circuits.\n\n## Review of Modular Cloning (MoClo)\n\nModular Cloning allows the assembly of genetic parts—promoters, coding sequences, terminators, and other regulatory elements—into standardized expression cassettes.
