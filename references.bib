	abstract = {Beneficial association with symbiotic fungi helps improve growth and fitness in most land plants and shows great potential as biofertilizers in precision agriculture. Here, we demonstrated that a root fungal endophyte, Tinctoporellus species isolate AR8, enabled yield improvement in Brassicaceae leafy green choy sum (Brassica rapa var. parachinensis). Mechanistically, AR8 colonized the root cortex/endosphere and channeled the metabolic flux to phenylpropanoids and requisite secondary metabolites to promote plant growth. AR8-assisted biosynthesis of auxin improved root growth and provided an intrinsic source for long-distance signaling that enhanced shoot biomass. Chemical complementation with exogenous p-coumaric acid restored auxin signaling and enhanced growth in AR8-inoculated pal1 mutant plants, thus implicating such a phenylpropanoid-auxin nexus as a pivotal regulator of symbiotic plant growth. Comparative metabolomics established hydroxycinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid as major plant-growth-promoting hubs that bridge the phenylpropanoid pathway and auxin signaling in the cross-kingdom AR8 symbiotic interaction model.},
