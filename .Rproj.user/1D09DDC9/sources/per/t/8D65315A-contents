title: "Level 0 Part Plasmid Design"
---

## Overview

This chapter introduces students to experimental design in the context of synthetic biology and the practical construction of Level 0 part plasmids using Modular Cloning (MoClo) and the Yeast Toolkit (YTK).

We build on the previous lecture's discussion of MoClo principles and emphasize hands-on experience with designing and assembling modular DNA parts for use in downstream genetic circuits.

## Review of Modular Cloning (MoClo)

Modular Cloning allows the assembly of genetic parts—promoters, coding sequences, terminators, and other regulatory elements—into standardized expression cassettes. Each part is cloned into a **Level 0 plasmid**, which can be stored, replicated, and reused.

### Key Principles

- Uses **Type IIS restriction enzymes** (e.g., BsaI and BsmBI) that cut outside their recognition sites, allowing for **scarless assembly**.
- Each part is flanked by **standardized 4 bp overhangs**, which determine its position and compatibility within an expression cassette.
- Level 0 parts can be assembled into **Level 1 cassettes** (single gene), and multiple Level 1 cassettes can be assembled into **Level 2 constructs** (multigene systems).

## Software Tools for Primer and Part Design

### Benchling

Benchling is a browser-based molecular biology tool for sequence annotation, primer design, and cloning simulations.

**To use Benchling:**

1. Import or create your DNA sequence.
2. Annotate regions (promoter, CDS, terminator).
3. Use the *"Primer"* tool to design and label forward and reverse primers.
4. For reverse primers, use the *"Copy Special > Reverse Complement"* option.
5. Simulate Golden Gate assembly using *Assembly Wizards* or manual cloning.

### Ape (A Plasmid Editor)

Ape is a downloadable tool that allows simple manipulation of DNA sequences.

- Supports reverse complement operations and editing.
- Useful for flipping 3′ to 5′ primers back into 5′ to 3′ notation.

## Activity Instructions

Students worked from:

- **YTK Assembly Manual (pages 12–26)**: This guide details how to construct each part type using standardized overhangs and restriction sites.
- **YTK Overhangs Primers Sheet (Google Sheets)**: Shared class document for assigning and recording primer sequences and overhangs.

### Group Workflow

1. Open the manual and locate your assigned part type (e.g., Type 1, 2, 3A, 3B...).
2. Record the **part name**, **5′ overhang**, **3′ overhang**.
3. Design forward and reverse primers:
    - Forward primer = [GC clamp] + [BsaI site] + [part-specific overhang] + [homology to template]
    - Reverse primer = Same logic, but **reverse complement** of the sequence

> TODO: Add primer design template for students to follow.

### Primer Design Guidelines

- Primers should always be written 5′ → 3′.
- Include at least 4 bp **GC clamp** before the restriction site.
- Use **BsaI** recognition site (GGTCTC) for Level 0 assembly.
- Add part-specific overhangs immediately downstream of the enzyme site.
- Add **GG** for fusion proteins (e.g., Type 3B parts) to maintain codon frame.
- Include a **stop codon** and/or **XhoI site** for terminator parts as needed.

## Practical Considerations

### In-Frame Assembly

- Coding sequences often require special care to preserve the reading frame across part boundaries.
- For example, combining Type 3A and 3B parts (both coding) needs a GG insertion to keep translation in-frame.

### Negative Controls

- Use mutant promoters (e.g., PIA19mut) that lack binding sites to demonstrate ARF-specific activation.
- Design primers that omit ARFs or use constitutively inactive variants as negative controls.

> TODO: Provide table of part types and expected features (start codon, stop codon, etc.).

## Constructing Level 0 Parts

To make a new Level 0 part:

1. Identify the **source sequence** (synthesized, genomic DNA, etc.).
2. Design primers to amplify the sequence:
   - Add **BsaI site**, overhangs, and homology arms.
3. PCR amplify the part.
4. Digest both the PCR product and **Level 0 entry vector** with BsaI.
5. Ligate the digested insert and vector.
6. Transform into competent **E. coli** and select colonies.
7. Screen clones by colony PCR or sequencing.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Double-check primer orientation and melting temperatures (55–72°C).
- Avoid internal BsaI or BsmBI sites within the part sequence.
- Use Benchling to simulate and verify assembly.

## Summary

This activity combined theoretical and practical training in modular cloning. Students learned to:

- Navigate cloning toolkits and design compatible parts
- Use software to annotate sequences and design primers
- Understand the logic of MoClo part assembly

These skills will be applied to build expression cassettes and multigene constructs for synthetic biology experiments in upcoming weeks.

## Next Steps

- Finalize primer designs for assigned part types.
- Submit sequences for synthesis or begin PCR amplification.
- Prepare for Level 0 part cloning and validation.
